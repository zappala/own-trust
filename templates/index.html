      <h1>TLS is completely broken in many applications</h1>

      <p>A number of papers have analyzed vulnerabilities in
      applications that use TLS libraries. Applications frequently do not properly validate the server’s
      certificate or configure TLS properly.</p>
      
      <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">The root cause of most of these vulnerabilities is
      the terrible design of the APIs to the underlying SSL
      libraries.</p>

      <h1>Patch Broken Systems</h1>
      
      <p>TrustBase transparently enforces correct certificate
      validation and applies system policy for all applications.  The
      Secure Socket API, and its associated system policy, can be
      enforced on applications that dynamically load a security
      library such as OpenSSL.</p>
